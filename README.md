- There are repositories similar to this out there but most have not been updated for some time. 
2ish years. With the ever changing scope of the webstack (ReactRouter v4, Bootstrap4, etc) It's
important to have modern versions out there for people to use and reference. Plus this aims to be 
better in a lot of other aspects from what's out there.
